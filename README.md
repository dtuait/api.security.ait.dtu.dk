This is a self documenting REST API Build in Django. The philosophy behind this app is to provide a unified interface that brings together data sources like Active Directory, SCCM, Microsoft Defender, and Cisco Network into a single pane of glass. This foundation enables automation and, more importantly, facilitates informed decision-making through AI-generated lists based on data from these sources.

This app is designed for environments with multiple sub-IT departments, where security restrictions prevent full access to systems like SCCM or Microsoft Defender. For example, a sub-IT department can query SCCM to retrieve a list of all computers in their department, along with the software installed on those computers. This app makes such functionality possible. The web portal offers services through a UI/UX experience built on this app's API. For instance, there is currently a service that allows for MFA resets.

## Running with Gunicorn

### Test mode
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r app-main/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the application with Gunicorn in test mode (auto-reloading on changes):
   ```bash
   gunicorn app.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8121 --reload
   ```

## Local development with devcontainers

This repository ships with a [VS Code Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) configuration
in `.devcontainer/`. The default `my-development-docker-compose.yaml` file mirrors the production stack, but keeps the Django
process idle so you can run management commands directly from your IDE. Copy `.devcontainer/.env.example` to
`.devcontainer/.env`, supply the required secrets, and open the folder with the "Dev Containers" VS Code extension to start
developing.

## Token Storage and Microsoft APIs

- Microsoft Graph and Defender bearer tokens are generated using client credentials from environment variables and are persisted in the database (`graph.ServiceToken`).
- Do not provide bearer tokens via environment variables anymore; any legacy `*_ACCESS_BEARER_TOKEN` values are ignored except for a one-time bootstrap into the database at startup.
- You can proactively generate and persist tokens by running: `python app-main/manage.py refresh_service_tokens` (optionally pass `--service graph` or `--service defender`).

## Deploying with Coolify + Traefik

A detailed, step-by-step deployment walkthrough is available in
[`docs/coolify-deployment-guide.md`](docs/coolify-deployment-guide.md). In summary, Coolify can build and run the application
directly from this repository using the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.coolify.yml` compose descriptor. The compose
file wires the Django container to PostgreSQL, exposes the Gunicorn service to Traefik, and provisions persistent volumes for
static and media assets.

At a minimum you will:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or paste the same key/value pairs into Coolify) and provide values for `DJANGO_SECRET`, the
   `POSTGRES_*` credentials, admin bootstrap credentials (`DJANGO_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `DJANGO_ADMIN_PASSWORD`), the optional
   `TRAEFIK_NETWORK` override, and any integration secrets you require.
2. Create a Coolify **Docker Compose** application that points to this repository and select `docker-compose.coolify.yml` as the
   compose file. The default Traefik labels expect the external network to be called `coolify-network` and will bind the router
   to the standard `https` entrypoint. If your Coolify host does not already have that network, SSH into the host once and run
   `docker network create coolify-network` (or set `TRAEFIK_NETWORK` to the Traefik network name you actually use) before
   triggering a deployment.
3. Deploy the stack. Coolify will build the image from `Dockerfile`, run database migrations and `collectstatic` via
   `docker/entrypoint.sh`, and expose the site through Traefik on the hostname configured by `SERVICE_FQDN_WEB`.

Environment keys surfaced in Coolify by default (no secrets committed):

- `SERVICE_FQDN_WEB` (default: `api.security.ait.dtu.dk`)
- `SERVICE_URL_WEB` (default: `https://api.security.ait.dtu.dk`)
- `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (default: `api.security.ait.dtu.dk`)
- `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` (default: `https://api.security.ait.dtu.dk`)
- `DJANGO_CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN` (default: empty)
- `DJANGO_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` (default: `true`)
- `DJANGO_CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` (default: `true`)
- `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` (default: `true`)
- `DJANGO_ADMIN_USERNAME`/`DJANGO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (no defaults; used to seed the Django admin account on startup)
- `POSTGRES_DB` (default: `app`)
- `POSTGRES_USER` (default: `app`)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (default: `please-change-me`; update both the app and database if you change it)

Required at deploy time (Coolify will prompt):

- `DJANGO_SECRET`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

Optional routing variables (labels):

- `TRAEFIK_NETWORK` (override if your Traefik network is not `coolify-network`)

### Using a custom TLS certificate with Coolify's Traefik

If you rely on an internal or wildcard certificate instead of Traefik's Letâ€™s Encrypt integration, copy the certificate bundle
and private key to the host so that the Traefik container can read them:

1. SSH to the Coolify host and create a directory under `/data/coolify/proxy/certs/` (this path is mounted as `/traefik/certs`
   inside the proxy container). For example:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /data/coolify/proxy/certs/star_api_security_ait_dtu_dk
   sudo cp /data/coolify/certs/star_api_security_ait_dtu_dk/star_security_ait_dtu_dk_cert.pem \
     /data/coolify/proxy/certs/star_api_security_ait_dtu_dk/
   sudo cp /data/coolify/certs/star_api_security_ait_dtu_dk/star_security_ait_dtu_dk.key \
     /data/coolify/proxy/certs/star_api_security_ait_dtu_dk/
   sudo chmod 600 /data/coolify/proxy/certs/star_api_security_ait_dtu_dk/*.key
   ```

2. Declare the certificate in `/data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/certs.yaml` so Traefik loads it at runtime:

   ```yaml
   tls:
     certificates:
       - certFile: /traefik/certs/star_api_security_ait_dtu_dk/star_security_ait_dtu_dk_cert.pem
         keyFile: /traefik/certs/star_api_security_ait_dtu_dk/star_security_ait_dtu_dk.key
   ```

3. Restart the proxy with `docker restart coolify-proxy`. Once Traefik reloads, HTTPS requests to
   `https://api.security.ait.dtu.dk` will present your uploaded certificate while still routing to the Django container defined
   in `docker-compose.coolify.yml`.

To run the same stack locally without Coolify:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Update POSTGRES_PASSWORD if you do not want to use the default `please-change-me`
# and ensure the value matches the password stored in the PostgreSQL volume.
# Create the external Traefik network expected by the compose file (run once)
docker network create coolify-network
docker compose -f docker-compose.coolify.yml up --build
```

The web container automatically waits for PostgreSQL, applies migrations, and runs `collectstatic` on startup. Static and
media files persist across deployments via the named volumes defined in the compose file. If your Traefik network has a
different name locally, set `TRAEFIK_NETWORK=<your-network>` before starting Compose instead of creating `coolify-network`.
