# Coolify Deployment Guide

This guide walks through deploying the API Security Django application to a self-hosted [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) instance. Coolify uses Docker Compose behind the scenes, so the repository ships with everything you need for a reproducible deployment.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A running Coolify v3+ installation with access to the **Docker Compose** application type.
- Traefik configured as Coolify's reverse proxy (Coolify sets this up automatically). Have an FQDN ready and pointed at your Coolify host via DNS.
- SSH access or a Git integration (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or a generic Git URL) so Coolify can pull this repository.
- Application secrets, directory credentials, and API tokens for the data sources you plan to use (see [Environment variables](#2-prepare-environment-variables)).

## 2. Prepare environment variables

The project reads its configuration from environment variables. Copy `.env.example` in the repository to `.env` to review the available settings and gather the values you will need. In Coolify you will create the same keys under **Settings → Environment Variables** for the application.

At minimum set the following values:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SERVICE_FQDN_WEB` | Public hostname (e.g., `api.security.ait.dtu.dk`). |
| `SERVICE_URL_WEB` | Public URL with scheme (e.g., `https://api.security.ait.dtu.dk`). |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated hostnames served by Django. |
| `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Should include `SERVICE_URL_WEB`. |
| `DJANGO_CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN` | Cookie domain; often same as `SERVICE_FQDN_WEB`. |
| `DJANGO_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `DJANGO_CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`, `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` | Production security flags (defaults true). |
| `DJANGO_SECRET` | A long random string used for Django's cryptographic signing. (required) |
| `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Credentials for PostgreSQL. (required: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`). The default password in `.env.example` is `please-change-me`; keep the same value for both the web and database services. |
| `TRAEFIK_NETWORK` | Override if your Traefik network is not named `coolify-network`. |
| `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`, `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` | Credentials you will use to create an administrative user after deployment. |

All of the other entries in `.env.example` are optional or relate to integrations (Azure AD, SCCM, Microsoft Defender, OpenAI, etc.). Populate them as needed for your environment.

> **Tip:** Leave `DJANGO_DEBUG=false` in production and keep `DJANGO_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `DJANGO_CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`, and `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` set to `true` to enforce HTTPS-only cookies.

## 3. Add the application in Coolify

1. In Coolify, click **New Application → Docker Compose**.
2. Choose the Git provider and repository that hosts this project, then select the branch you want to deploy (typically `main`).
3. When prompted for the compose file path, enter `docker-compose.coolify.yml`. Leave the working directory as `/` unless you have the repository nested deeper.
4. Coolify will detect the services defined in the compose file:
   - `web`: Builds from the repository `Dockerfile`, runs Gunicorn on port `8121`, and exposes the Django app. It mounts persistent volumes for `/data/static` and `/data/media`.
   - `db`: Uses the official `postgres:16` image with a persistent volume for the database cluster.
5. Under the **Environment Variables** tab, add the keys discussed above (copy/paste from your `.env`). You can bulk import by pasting the contents of your `.env` file.
6. Ensure the Traefik network name matches your setup. By default the compose file expects an external network named `coolify-network`. Adjust the `TRAEFIK_NETWORK` variable if your Traefik network is different, or create the network beforehand. On a raw Docker host (for example when rehearsing locally) run `docker network create coolify-network` once to satisfy the external network reference. Coolify creates `coolify-network` automatically when Traefik is enabled.


## 4. First deployment

1. Click **Deploy**. Coolify will:
   - Build the application image using the provided `Dockerfile` (installs system packages, Python dependencies, and copies the project code).
   - Launch PostgreSQL and wait for it to become healthy.
   - Start the Django container, which runs `manage.py migrate` and `collectstatic` automatically via `docker/entrypoint.sh`.
2. Watch the deployment logs to ensure migrations complete successfully and that Gunicorn is listening on port `8121`.
3. Once Traefik provisions a certificate and routes traffic, browse to `https://<your-domain>` to confirm the site is online.

## 5. Create an administrative user

If no superuser exists yet, open the Coolify application page, go to the **Actions → Execute Command** menu for the `web` service, and run:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser --username "$DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME" --email you@example.com
```

Provide the same password you configured in the environment variables when prompted. You can now log in to the admin interface and configure integrations.

## 6. Ongoing management

- **Updating the application:** Push new commits to the tracked branch and trigger a redeploy in Coolify. The entrypoint will re-run migrations and collect static assets as needed.
- **Running management commands:** Use Coolify's “Execute Command” feature on the `web` container to run scripts such as `python manage.py shell` or custom management commands.
- **Backups:** The compose file defines named volumes (`postgres_data`, `static_data`, `media_data`). Configure backups for these volumes in your Coolify host to protect database and media content.

## 7. Local smoke test (optional)

You can rehearse the deployment locally with Docker Compose to verify your configuration before pushing to production:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with the values you plan to use
docker network create coolify-network  # satisfies the external Traefik network dependency
docker compose -f docker-compose.coolify.yml up --build
```

If you already have a differently named Traefik network, skip the `docker network create` command and export `TRAEFIK_NETWORK=<your-network>` before running Compose. The stack will come up exactly as Coolify orchestrates it, so you can validate migrations, networking, and integrations ahead of time.

## 8. Troubleshooting

### `network coolify-network declared as external, but could not be found`

This error appears when Docker cannot find the Traefik network referenced by the compose file. On Coolify hosts the network is
usually created automatically, but if you see this message:

```
network coolify-network declared as external, but could not be found
```

SSH into the Coolify server and create the network once:

```bash
docker network create coolify-network
```

If your Traefik installation uses a different network name, set the `TRAEFIK_NETWORK` environment variable in Coolify to that
name instead of creating `coolify-network`.

### `django.db.utils.OperationalError: password authentication failed`

This indicates Django cannot authenticate to PostgreSQL. Confirm that:

1. The value of `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is identical for the `web` and `db` services.
2. The password matches the credentials already stored in the PostgreSQL data volume. If you change the password, update the database user inside PostgreSQL or recreate the volume so the new credentials take effect.
3. Environment variables are not defined as empty strings in Coolify or your `.env` file. Remove unused keys rather than leaving them blank so Docker Compose can fall back to the defaults documented in `.env.example`.

### Requests time out at the gateway

Traefik will return a 504 timeout if it cannot reach Gunicorn inside the Django container. To confirm whether requests actually
arrive at the application, tail the **Server → web** logs in Coolify while making a request to your domain. Each request now
emits a Gunicorn access log entry such as:

```
[2023-09-14 08:31:26 +0000] [17] [INFO] 172.20.0.5 - - "GET /healthz/ HTTP/1.1" 200 17 "-" "curl/8.4.0"
```

If you see entries like this, Traefik successfully routed the call to Django and the response code in the log will indicate the
outcome. If no entries appear, the request likely never left Traefik—double-check the `TRAEFIK_NETWORK` environment variable, that the
service is listening on port `8121`, and that the container is healthy in Coolify.

### Serve a custom TLS certificate through Traefik

Coolify mounts `/data/coolify/proxy` from the host into the Traefik container at `/traefik`. If you are using a wildcard or
internal CA certificate instead of Traefik's ACME resolver, add the files there and declare them in a dynamic configuration file:

1. Copy the certificate and private key into `/data/coolify/proxy/certs/<your-folder>/` on the host. The PEM file should contain
   the full chain.
2. Create or update `/data/coolify/proxy/dynamic/certs.yaml` with:

   ```yaml
   tls:
     certificates:
       - certFile: /traefik/certs/<your-folder>/<certificate>.pem
         keyFile: /traefik/certs/<your-folder>/<certificate>.key
   ```

3. Restart Traefik (`docker restart coolify-proxy`). The router defined in `docker-compose.coolify.yml` will now serve your
   uploaded certificate on the `https` entrypoint while forwarding requests to Gunicorn.
